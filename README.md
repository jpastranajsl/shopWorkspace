Project made on third semester of Informatics bachelor degree, simulating a library shop environment.
It includes a text file with data of the books available in the shop, you can search by their codes and then add to their basket. Then choose either cash or card as payment method.
It also has the option of recording the sales on a session.

To build, you can either lunch visual studio from the code button, download the zip file and extract its content, or clone the repository directly in Visual Studio.
